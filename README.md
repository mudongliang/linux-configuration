# linux-configuration

My favourite distribution is Debian. And I usually use Debian Stable with GNOME as my desktop environment.

I store some configuration files (e.g, vimrc, bashrc) into this repository.

- bashrc : new bash commands
- bin : some useful scripts, or binary files
- gnome_extensions : gnome extension list
- software : software list
- sources.list.d : new sources list
- vimrc : vim configuration
